## Synaptics Neural Network Acceleration and Processing

SyNAP is an acronym for *Synaptics Neural Network Acceleration and Processing*. It originally
started a few years back as a simple Python wrapper around the Verisilicon Acuity toolkit in
order to simply the creation and testing of the AS370 SoC powering the Google Nest smart home
product. Since then it has grown into a full AI framework for various Synaptics SoC.

For now this project is just hosting a number of forks that we needs internally for SyNAP; in the
future the goal is to open up the SyNAP framework to the public, stay tuned...
